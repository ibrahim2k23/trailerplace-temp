"""Split one finished assistant reply into the bubbles the chat UI sends it in.

A reply that shows six trailers is one wall of text in a single bubble: the customer has to
scroll past five trailers they did not want to reach the closing question, and every listing
title - the hyperlink that opens the trailer - is buried in the middle of it. Sent as chunks,
each trailer arrives as its own message with its own tappable title, exactly the way a
salesperson would send them one after another.

The card shape this parses is the one src/llm/respond.py's prompt dictates, and the same one
_strip_listing_blocks() edits:

    1. [2026 Iron Bull DTB - 15081](https://...)
       - Category: Utility
       - Price: $9,995
       - One sales-pitch sentence.

So: everything before the first card is the intro (split on blank lines), each card is its own
chunk, and whatever follows the last card (the closing question) is the final chunk. A reply
with no cards is split on blank lines alone - which is what makes the mandated opening line
("Thank you for contacting TrailerPlace.") arrive as its own short message.
